# graffitiview: Steetview graffiti collection
Collecting a dataset of panoramas from Google Streetview and searching for graffiti pieces.
This experiment was created during a machine learning CoCreate course at HGK FHNW by [@gu-ma](https://github.com/gu-ma)


*I used a [model](https://github.com/abundis-rmn2/graffiti_detection_OD_TF) by **abundis-rmn2** for the actual graffiti detection.* *Also for the dataset creation, I used a beautiful [library](https://github.com/sk-zk/streetlevel) created by **sk-zk**, that allowed me to fetch panoramas in a given region without any access to the official API :P*

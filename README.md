# graffitiview: Steetview graffiti collection
Collecting a dataset of panoramas from Google Streetview and searching for graffiti pieces.
This experiment was created during a machine learning CoCreate course at HGK FHNW by [@gu-ma](https://github.com/gu-ma)


*I used a [model](https://github.com/abundis-rmn2/graffiti_detection_OD_TF) by **abundis-rmn2** for the graffiti detection*
